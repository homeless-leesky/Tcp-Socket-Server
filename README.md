# Tcp-Socket-Server
1. I worked in a **WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux) Ubuntu 18.04 environment**. and I edited with **Visual Studio code Editor**.<br>
2. **It was a my university class**, then i wanna remember how to make socket server with c-lang<br>
3. but it is a reallllllly simple socket server, so I think, It is working in only local network -> ***maybe will wrong thing*** <br>
<br>

## 1. Tcp-echo-server.c ##
